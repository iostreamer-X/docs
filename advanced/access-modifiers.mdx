To answer it simply, `public` properties are compiled by us and `private` ones are left alone.
So, if you have a public method, you'd see it on the playground, and other nodes will be able to interact
with it.

But if it's a private method, then our compiler doesn't even touch it. It's purely for internal uses only.

## When to use what?
If you want to show something and make it part of your story then it should be public. But you won't be able
to mess with it much. For example, you can't override it in story script. Also, a few things simply won't work directly, like
calling those public methods from `map`, `filter` et al.

Which is why, private methods are more suited for behind the scene processing you might need. So, all the data massaging
can go into private methods but all conditionals representing business logic should be part of public methods.

<Note>You can also compose private methods and keep you code clean!</Note>

## Caveats
You can call private methods from public ones, but not vice versa. This is because a private method doesn't even end up
on playground but more importantly, it breaks the logical hierarchy that exists.

Think of it like a layered architecture where a layer is only allowed to interact with ones below it. And in our case
the public methods represent the business logic layer and private methods are the agnostic building blocks.
