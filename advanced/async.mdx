We support async/await and promise natively, and the easiest way to do that is how you might do this in realworld code.
Say you have a synchronous function and you want to fire off a background task without caring for its result immediately.

<Warning>Storing returned promises and handling them is not supported yet</Warning>

To do this in JS environments, one might write code like this:

```typescript async-demo.ts
class Docker {
  readonly shouldCrash?: boolean;
  
  container() {
    if (this.shouldCrash) {
      return 'exiting with code 1';
    }
    console.log('We are calling our sideCar without waiting for its result')
    this.sideCar('hello world!');

    const result = this.db();
    this.cache();
  }

  db() {
  }

  cache() {
  }

  async sideCar(arg: string) {
    await this.wait();
    console.log(`Logging: ${arg}`)
  }

    private async wait() {
        return new Promise<void>(resolve=>setTimeout(resolve, 5000))
    }
}
```
