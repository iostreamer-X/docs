title: Higher Order Function
---
As we saw in the [this](/runtime#state-machines) section, methods get transformed into state-machines. The compiler does this
quite aggressively to all the functions to cover maximum ground without leaving anything behind.

With that, it runs the risk of transforming functions that should be left un-touched, especially higher order
functions.

To prevent that from happening, you should wrap the function you intend to pass around in `std.lambda`. It's just
a wrapper but tells the compiler to skip its transformation.

<Warning>Higher Order Functions is an experimental feature.</Warning>
