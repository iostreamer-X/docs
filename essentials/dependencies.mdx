You are free to use methods from other classes but there are a few rules.

### Importing is implicit

When referencing other classes and methods, our IDE will provide them to you directly in the scope.
No need to write explicit import statements.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript docker-demo.ts
/* No import statement here */

class Docker {
  readonly shouldCrash?: boolean;

    /* You just add dependencies as members */
    public sideCar: SideCar;
  
    container() {
        if (this.shouldCrash) {
        return 'exiting with code 1';
        }
        this.sideCar.log('hello world!');
    }
}
```
```typescript sidecar.ts

/* Notice that we are not exporting anything */
class SideCar {
  log(arg: string) {
    console.log(`Logging: ${arg}`)
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>


### Dependencies are injected
As we saw above, you simply add dependencies as members and our compiler will take care of injecting them.
You can put them in constructor or as members or something nested and it will all work

```typescript docker-demo.ts
class Docker {

    /* Usable as this.sideCar */
    public sideCar: SideCar;

    public dependencies: {
        external: {
            /* Usable as this.dependencies.external.sideCar */
            sideCar: SideCar,
        }
    }

    constructor(
        /* Usable as this.anotherSideCar */
        readonly anotherSideCar: SideCar
    ) {

    }
}
```
