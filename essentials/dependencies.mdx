You are free to use methods from other classes but there are a few rules.

### Importing is implicit

When referencing other classes and methods, our IDE will provide them to you directly in the scope.
No need to write explicit import statements.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript docker-demo.ts
/* No import statement here */

class Docker {
  readonly shouldCrash?: boolean;

    /* You just add dependencies as members */
    public sideCar: SideCar;

    /**
     * You can also have a nested object acting as a dependency and it
     * will be handled automatically.
    */
    public dependencies: {
        external: {
            /* Usable as this.dependencies.external.sideCar */
            sideCar: SideCar,
        }
    }
  
    container() {
        if (this.shouldCrash) {
        return 'exiting with code 1';
        }

        /* The following two calls will reach the same method */
        this.sideCar.log('hello world!');
        this.dependencies.external.sideCar.log('hello again!')
    }
}
```
```typescript sidecar.ts

/* Notice that we are not exporting anything */
class SideCar {
  log(arg: string) {
    console.log(`Logging: ${arg}`)
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>


### Dependencies are injected

The reason you don't have to import anything is because we build an internal DI container. Any method calling
another method, uses this DI container to reach it.

This also means that if you were to instantiate classes manually, they will not be reachable by other methods.
