You can use the IDE and code to tell the behaviour of architecture but not how it should
look. That you can do in the playground!

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Icons">
    ## Personality for your nodes
    Each node, regardless of where it comes from, be it from a class or a method, or folder structure, can have icons.
    We integrate with `iconify` and load the icons dynamically. The logo set we are using is for tech logos,
    so you will always get relevant icons.

    <Frame type="glass">
      <img
        className="hidden dark:block"
        src="/images/icons.gif"
        alt="icons"
      />
    </Frame>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Edge Labels">
    ## Context for connections
    It's equally important to talk about the communication that happens between nodes. Simply hover over an edge
    and that will open the label for you to edit.

    <Frame type="glass">
      <img
        className="hidden dark:block"
        src="/images/edge_label.gif"
        alt="icons"
      />
    </Frame>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Node positioning">
    ## Create your own layout

    We might not come up with the layout that you want, but that doesn't mean that you can't create it yourself.
    Move the nodes wherever you want and their positions will synced.

    <Frame type="glass">
      <img
        className="hidden dark:block"
        src="/images/node_move.gif"
        alt="icons"
      />
    </Frame>
