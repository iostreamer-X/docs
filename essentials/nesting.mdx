So we know that a class would be a big node and inside it we'd have smaller nodes for all the methods of the class. 
But that's not how real life diagrams are represented. There are parent child relationships, domains & sub-domains that we need to express as well.

And the way we solve it in metz is to use folder structure. There are two reasons why we chose this approach:

<Card icon="shelves-empty" >
  Keep code vanilla, don't add anything custom.
</Card>

<Card icon="folder-tree" iconType="duotone">
  Using a folder structure to create boxes around boxes forces you to define better boundaries.
</Card>


<br/>
Using code to create diagrams and by extension a design of the system, is amazing for a few reasons but we believe the best one is 'Foresight'. You can see and visualise what the structure of the code would be from the get go.

And hence that should be reflected when you are trying to create boundaries(or hierarchies).

<Tip>Because what's a folder, if not a repository masquerading?</Tip>

## How does it work?
Each folder tile is a drop zone onto which you can drag files and other folders.
For files, simply drag them but for folders, there's a dedicated drag handle that you have to use.

And the hierarchy of folders will be reflected as nesting of nodes.
