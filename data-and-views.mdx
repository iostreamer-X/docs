title: Data & Views
---

If you have a data member in your class, you can decorate it with `@Show` and it will be visible in the playground!

For example, check out the code for [Average Stock Price](https://app.metz.sh/try?templateId=7), and you will see that
we have decorated `averagePrice` with `@Show`. That's why it shows up here:
<Frame>
    <iframe width="900px" height="700px" src="https://app.metz.sh/play/0d0b90bfe8f0411dbde9f59071927be9?minimal=true" />
</Frame>

<Tip>You can decorate as many data members you want, event private ones!</Tip>

## Customizing how the data is presented
Say if you have a class which you are using to model a database. It has a member called `data`, which you'd want to decorate with `@Show`.

```typescript
type Order = {
	id: string;
	thing: string;
	status: string;
	createdAt: number;
};

class OrdersTable {
	@Show
	private data: Order[] = [];
}
```
This simply displays that array in playground. Wouldn't it be nice if `data` could actually be rendered as a table?

### Table View

Well, yes! That's why we have `@Table`, which you can decorate your class with. Simply provide the "columns" you want to show and you get a nice looking view!

For example:
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Code">
	  ```typescript

	  @Table(['id', 'thing', 'status', 'createdAt'])
	  class OrdersTable {
		@Show
		private data: Order[] = [];
	  }
	  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="View">
    ![](/images/table.png)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

This view takes the liberty of setting the icon as Postgres. You can change that to anything.

<Warning>With table view, only one member should be decorated with `@Show` and it should be an array of records.</Warning>

### Collection View
Similarly, we have `@Collection` to show objects.
For example:
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Code">
	  ```typescript

	  @Collection
	  class OrdersTable {
		@Show
		private data: Order[] = [];
	  }
	  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="View">
    ![](/images/cc.png)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
<Warning>With collection view, only one member should be decorated with `@Show` and it should be an array of records.</Warning>

### KeyValue View
And lastly, you can use `@KeyValue` to render a `Map`.

For example:
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Code">
	  ```typescript

	@KeyValue
	class Redis<T> {
		@Show
		data: Map<string, T> = new Map();
	}
	  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="View">
    ![](/images/keyvalue.png)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
<Warning>With keyvalue view, only one member should be decorated with `@Show` and it should be a `Map`.</Warning>

### Where did all the methods go?
When you assign a view to a class, the runtime collapses its corresponding node.

All the methods are hidden, and all the edges going to those methods
now go to the parent class node. Giving the view a clean look.

Mind you, simply decorating a member with `@Show` won't cause this. You have to assign a view to the class.
