Each class in instantiated exactly once and used throughout the story. If you want to show multiple instances of a class, inheritance is the way.

```typescript multiple-servers.ts
/* Common logic is present here */
class Server {
  serve() {
    return 'ok'
  }
}

/* The method 'serve' will be present in both Server1 and Server2 */

class Server1 extends Server {

}

class Server2 extends Server {
  
}
```
