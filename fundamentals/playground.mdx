One big advantage of using code is that we can actually run it. But our VM goes beyond that and provides
you a debugger like experience. With that, you can pause execution, step through the flow, see the input of methods and much more.

## Build code
This is actually fairly simple. Just click the 'Build' button on top right and expand 'Preview' to see your changes.

## Run your code
After opening playground, you'd have a bar at the bottom, pretty much like a video player. You can play/pause
the execution or explore the flow step by step using the button next to it.

You can also click on nodes to see there current state and the timeline of their past states.

Once the flow is complete, simply press the reset button to pull everything back.
