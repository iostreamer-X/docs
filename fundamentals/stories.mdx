Software architectures usually have many dimensions, like what if this happens, or what if this is the input given, or if this breaks down?
With stories you can cover all of them and present your design from different vantage points.

This where the class nature of code comes quite handy. We saw that the class itself becomes the the outer box and the methods are the
nodes inside whose state you can observe. But what about the data and member fields in the classes? Where do they show up?

Well, here of course! You can use those member fields as levers and switches to have conditional logic in your code. And with stories you can
create a script telling exactly which track to go on.

## How does it work?

The story script modal is another instance of our IDE where you can write code. It expects a script detailing how exactly should the story go.
We parse all the classes and methods, and provide stubs for you to interact with. For each class that you created, you are provided an 'instance' of it.
You can use that instance to set its member values to whatever you want!

For code that looks like:
```typescript docker-demo.ts
class Docker {
  readonly shouldCrash?: boolean;
  
  container() {
    if (this.shouldCrash) {
      return 'exiting with code 1';
    }
    this.sideCar(
      this.parseLog(
        'hello world!'
      )
    )
  }

  sideCar(arg: string) {
    console.log(`Logging: ${arg}`)
  }

  private parseLog(arg: string) {
    return `${new Date().toISOString()}: ${arg}`
  }
}
```

The script will already have `docker` available in its scope. It will behave very much like an instance which
will allow you to access `shouldCrash` and set it to either `true` or `false` depending on the story you want to tell.

### Entrypoint

Each story must have an entrypoint, telling which function gets called first. Given our story script is pretty much a script
you can just call a function and it will be treated as the entrypoint. 

<Warning>Starting two nodes parallely by calling two entrypoints is not supported as of now.</Warning>

For example, in the aforementioned code, we want to create a story which covers `container` successfully running. Our script will look like:
```typescript
docker.shouldCrash = false;
docker.container();
```


## Overriding

You can override anything except for public methods! 

```typescript docker-demo-story-script.ts
docker.shouldCrash = false;

/* 
* We need to index the private fields like this to override them since the 
* dot notation doesn't allow access to private keys.
*/
docker['parseLog'] = (arg) => `Logged at ${new Date().toLocaleString()}: ${arg}`

docker.container();
```
