Software architectures usually have many dimensions, like what if this happens, or what if this is the input given, or if this breaks down?
With stories you can cover all of them and present your design from different vantage points.

This where the class nature of code comes quite handy. We saw that the class itself becomes the the outer box and the methods are the
nodes inside whose state you can observe. But what about the data and member fields in the classes? Where do they show up?

Well, here of course! You can use those member fields as levers and switches to have conditional logic in your code. And with stories you can
create a script telling exactly which track to go on.

## How does it work?

The story script modal is another instance of our IDE where you can write code. It expects a script detailing how exactly should the story go.
We parse all the classes and methods, and provide stubs for you to interact with. For each class that you created, you are provided an 'instance' of it.
You can use that instance to set its member values to whatever you want!

<Warning>Make sure you don't overwrite method definitions themselves!</Warning>

For code that looks like:
```typescript docker-demo.ts
class Docker {
  readonly shouldCrash?: boolean;
  
  container() {
    if (this.shouldCrash) {
      return 'exiting with code 1';
    }
    this.sideCar('hello world!')
  }

  sideCar(arg: string) {
    console.log(`Logging: ${arg}`)
  }
}
```

The script will already have `docker` available in its scope. It will behave very much like an instance which
will allow you to access `shouldCrash` and set it to either `true` or `false` depending on the story you want to tell.

### Entrypoint

Each story must have an entrypoint, telling which function gets called first. Given our story script is pretty much a script
you can just call a function and it will be treated as the entrypoint. 

For example, in the aforementioned code, we want to create a story which covers `container` successfully running. Our script will look like:
```typescript
docker.shouldCrash = false;
docker.container();
```

## More than just conditionals

You are not confined to just `if/else` statements. Whatever the type you choose for member variables, you can assign a value of that type in the script.

For example, you can mock an entire database interaction and have precise control in your stories over what gets returned as the result of the query.
