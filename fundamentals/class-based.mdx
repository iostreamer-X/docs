title: Class based code
description: 'Creates and nodes and edges'
---

In metz, everything is classes and methods. This works well when you think about boxes and hierarchies that you see
in typical diagrams. A class represents a common behaviour with some data and methods to carry out that behaviour.

And that's what we render as boxes. Each class acts as a parent node, holding child nodes which represent methods.

<Note>We currently only support TypeScipt</Note>

```typescript
/*boundary*/
class Docker {
  
  /*data*/
  readonly shouldCrash?: boolean;
  
  /*behavior*/
  container() {
    if (this.shouldCrash) {
      return 'exiting with code 1';
    }
  }
}
```

    alt="How classes and methods are rendered"
  />
</Frame>

### Edges
So we have boxes but how do we get lines between them? Well, they come from function calls!

```typescript
class Docker {
  readonly shouldCrash?: boolean;
  
  container() {
    if (this.shouldCrash) {
      return 'exiting with code 1';
    }
    this.sideCar('hello world!')
  }

  sideCar(arg: string) {
    console.log(`Logging: ${arg}`)
  }
}
```

<Frame

    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/edge_demo.gif"
    alt="How edges are rendered"
  />
