Metz is a powerful tool for creating interactive diagrams from TypeScript code. You can use it to express complex engineering ideas or even abstract ones. With metz, communication is just a coding problem!

But it's also a long way from drawing boxes and lines. It's a different way of thinking about documentation and communication.

## Mental Model
When designing, regardless of level, we are used to breaking down the system in components. Next, we figure out how components interact with each other.
And that's usually the end of it.

It's the end of it, because the standard tools can't take you any further. But with metz, you are nudged to solve the problem using code.
One distinct feature of using code, is that you get behaviour for free. And that's where metz shines.

Say you were to design a system where you have multiple cron jobs, polling databases and updating them. You can absolutely have boxes represents databases
and some more boxes to represent a service & cron jobs.
<br/>But with metz, you could just write the most bare bones code for it, and metz will visualise it for you.

For example, the code for poller, simply looks like this
```typescript poller.ts

class Poller {
    private ordersTable = std.resolve(OrdersTable);
    private pollingCollection = std.resolve(PollingCollection);

    poll() {
        //Update all 'pending' orders to 'processing' state
        const updatedOrder = this.ordersTable.update(
            {
                status: 'processing'
            },
            std.lambda(order => order.status === 'pending')
        )

        if(!updatedOrder) {
            return
        }

        std.log('Got an order!')
        this.pollingCollection.insert({
            id: `poll_${updatedOrder.id}`,
            order_id: updatedOrder.id
        });
    }

}
```

## Advantages
It's subtle, but notice that there are two pollers but not two entries in polling collection.
The proposed design of a system like this, would have this crucial fact lost in a footnote.
And when implementing the design, someone could easily miss this required behaviour.

But when you use code, you weild the perfect medium to express such critical facts. And pair that with metz,
this behaviour becomes not only apparent but a first class citizen of documentation.

And that's what you get with metz. The ability to express engineering complexity using code, and the ease to communicate it with your audience.

Let's look the fundamental concept behind this, [classes](/classes).
