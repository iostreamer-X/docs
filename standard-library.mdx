title: The Standard Library
---

Metz exposes its standard library through the global variable `std`. It has everything needed to interact with the runtime and other helpers.

# `resolve`
Takes a class reference and gets its instance from the DI container.

```typescript
function resolve<T extends InjectableClasses>(
  classInstance: Constructor<T>
): T
```
**Example**

To retreive an instance of a class called `LoadBalancer`, you'd write:
```typescript
  const loadBalancer = std.resolve(LoadBalancer);
```

<Warning>This only works with classes participating in [Dependency Injection](/managing-classes/dependencies)</Warning>

# `flow`
Helper to create and run a [Flow](/core-concepts#flows)
```typescript
function flow<T extends AllClasses>(
  name: string, 
  classInstance: T, 
  options?: { after: number } | { every: number }
): MetzFlow<T>
```

Takes an instance of one of your classes, augments it and returns a `MetzFlow`. Which actually is a proxy of your given instance and has similar types.
When you execute a function on `MetzFlow`, the runtime creates a new flow and starts executing it.

**Example**
```typescript
  const loadBalancer = std.flow(
    'Route requests to servers', 
    std.resolve(LoadBalancer)
  );
  
  //This works because std.flow returns back the provided instance
  loadBalancer.shouldFail = true;
  
  loadBalancer.route();
```

Or a more succint way of doing it if you are not modifying anything:
```typescript
  const loadBalancer = std.resolve(LoadBalancer);
  std.flow('Route requests to servers', loadBalancer).route();
```
