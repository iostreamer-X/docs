description: 'Understanding how your code runs'

Our runtime is actually a thin layer over actual JavaScript runtime in your browser. But we will keep the name because it does a lot
of similar things.

Your code actually gets compiled into something that can emit metz's instruction set. Now that sounds complicated, except our
instruction set is simply:
```typescript
LOAD <ADDRESS>
UNLOAD <ADDRESS>
LOG <ANY[]>
HALT
```

The job of our runtime is to execute these instructions and render the executions on screen. So when you see a signal going from one box to another, that is actually our runtime executing `LOAD`.

### Tick

In traditional machines, the CPU operating at some frequency, runs the instructions. The frequency, which is actually the frequency of cycles, controls the speed at which this happens.

Our runtime has a similar setup, where the cycle, or in metz's terms, the tick is a first class entity. Everything happens on a tick, from function calls to logs.

### Tock
A tick is also a unit of time in metz. So when you say:
```typescript
const loadBalancer = std.resolve(LoadBalancer);
std.flow('Route requests to servers', loadBalancer, { every: 5 }).route();
```

The `{ every: 5 }` tells the runtime to execute this flow after every 5 ticks.

<Note>This is just like [Tron's cycles](https://tron.fandom.com/wiki/Cycle)</Note>

This enables you to reliably model time in your design. Whether you have paused the playground or not, real time doesn't affect your code.
