title: Flows-102
description: Anatomy of a Flow
---

We haven't covered the standard library yet, but for now, here are the basics: `std` is a globally available
module, there to help you interact with the runtime.

You create flows using `std.flow`. It takes two parameters:
1. Name of the flow
2. An instance of a class

And the rest would be best explained through the following graphics:
<Frame caption="A standard flow, lazily evaluated.">
	<img src="/images/std-flow.png" />
</Frame>
<br/>
<Frame caption="A scheduled flow, eagerly evaluated, run immediately.">
	<img src="/images/std-scheduled-flow.png" />
</Frame>

<br/>

`std.flow` lets you go through the looking glass. It lets you provide a new state machine to the runtime, such that
when it ticks, it manages this newly given state machine as well.

#### FlowGenerator
`std.flow` returns a `FlowGenerator`, which is an object that closely resembles the class instance that you provided.
With one key difference, it still has methods, but all of them are `FlowFunction`s.

#### FlowFunction
This is as close as we can get to referring the underlying state-machine. A `FlowFunction` represents a factory that
can produce one.

It returns a `ScheduledFlow` if a schedule is provided to `std.flow`, or a `FlowExecutor` if not.

## Lazy evaluation
When you don't provide a schedule, you get a `FlowExecutor`. This is a handle that encapsulates work.
A `FlowExecutor` doesn't mean that the underlying work has started, rather it gives you the ability to start
it whenever you want.

And in that sense, the runtime lazily evaluates flows, at least the ones that are not scheduled.

Which means you can do this:
```typescript
class Main {
	hello() {
		const flow = std.flow<Main>("Print!", this).world("Hello");
		this.print(flow); //We didn't call 'run' on flow, but gave it to 'print'.
	}

	world(arg: string) {
		std.log(`${arg} World!`);
	}

	// This takes a flow, and simply runs it.
	print(flow: std.FlowExecutor<void, Main['world']>) {
		flow.run();
	}
}
```
Try this code in the [playground](https://app.metz.sh/try) to see what happens!

<Warning>You can pass around flows like values, but be mindful of type arguments. They are essential to understanding
the call graph.<br/><br/>The [standard library](/standard-library) covers how to use this effectively.</Warning>

## Scheduled Flows
You can provide a schedule to `std.flow` to get a `ScheduledFlow`. A `schedule` is an object and it can
have <Tooltip tip="But not both!">either</Tooltip> of the following keys:

<ParamField path="after" type="number">
  Start the flow after given number of `ticks` have passed.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="every" type="number">
  Start a flow every time given number of `ticks` pass.
</ParamField>

A `ScheduledFlow` is evaluated immediately, and it begins its work in the same tick it's created. Which
means passing around `ScheduledFlow` doesn't provide any value.

But how do we compose flows? Can we even? Let's get our answers in the next section!
