title: Awaiting Flows
---

A `FlowExecutor` has `await(): RT` to enable the parent flow to await its result.

Here's an example:
```typescript
class Main {
	hello() {
		const flow = std.flow<Main>("Print!", this).world("Hello");
		this.print(flow);
	}

	world(arg: string) {
		return `${arg} World!`;
	}

	print(flow: std.FlowExecutor<string, Main['world']>) {
		const result = flow.await(); // We can 'await' a flow and get its result.
		std.log(result);
	}
}
```
The line `const result = flow.await();` will make the currently executing flow suspend until the awaited flow
is complete.

<Note>This is similar to async/await features that exist in other languages.</Note>

<Tip>
	If you await a flow, it will count as calling that method(`FlowFunction`) and hence an edge would be rendered.

	Try [playing](https://app.metz.sh/try) with `run()` and `await()` and see how the playground changes!

## Awaiting multiple flows

In real systems, you are often awaiting multiple things simultaneously, or racing them together.
That's exactly why we have `std.awaitAll()` and `std.awaitRace()`.

### `std.awaitAll`
This is the equivalent of JavaScript's [Promise.all](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all). It takes an array of `FlowExecutor` and returns an array
corresponding to results of given `FlowExecutor`s. For example:
```typescript
const result = std.awaitAll([
	flow1,
	flow2,
	flow3,
]);

std.log(result);
// Assuming all the flows returned 42. The above statement would log [42,42,42]
```

### `std.awaitRace`
This is the equivalent of JavaScript's [Promise.race](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/race).
It also takes an array of `FlowExecutor` but returns a single value corresponding to the flow which completed first. If a flow wins the race, the remaining flows are cancelled.
For example:
```typescript
const result = std.awaitRace([
	flow1,
	flow2,
	flow3,
]);

std.log(result);
// Assuming all the flows return 42, and flow3 completed first.
// The above statement would log 42
```

We have one last mechanism left, events. The tried and tested method for asynchronousity. Let's cover that in next section!
