title: Flows-101
---

Formally, a flow is a unit of execution. It resembles a thread from Java, a promise from JS and a Future from Rust.

But this doesn't tell why we have flows though. Yes, it's a "thread" but so what? We have Promises
in the <Tooltip tip="That's where the metz runtime actually runs!">browser</Tooltip>. What's so special about a Flow?

## Capturing context

Say we have a story script like:
```typescript
const main = new Main();
main.hello();
```

The idea is to kick off the behaviour that is contained in `hello`. But why? What's the context? What if we run
`main.hello()` again, but for completely different reasons? How do we differentiate those two executions?

Simply put, we can't. Just running a function doesn't tell anything about it.

And that's where `Flow` comes in. It is always named, and you can see how different flows are affecting the system and each other.

<Tip>You can assign any name to a flow, but it helps if it'a aligned with the use-case you are trying to show.</Tip>

You can create a flow through the following syntax:
```typescript
std.flow(
	"<name of the flow>",
	main, // An instance of a class.
)
.hello() // Simply call the method you want to run.
.run(); // Normal flows are not eagerly executed, call 'run' when you want.
```

<Accordion title="My flow is not running. Why?">
1. Did you use `std.flow` to create it?
2. If yes, then did you pass an instance of the class and not some other object?
3. Did you call the method you want to execute?
4. Did you call `.run()` on the method you want to execute?

If the answer is yes to all the question and it still doesn't work, please [create an issue](https://github.com/metz-sh/simulacrum/issues/new) on github.

There's so much more to flows but we will stop here for now and dig deeper in [Flows-102](/flows-102).

And with that, we have learnt the basic building blocks of metz. Go to the [playground](https://app.metz.sh/try) to try those things,
but come back soon!

In the next section we will cover how to go beyond just one class and file.
