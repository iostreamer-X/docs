title: Files and Scope
---

Metz emulates a simple in-memory filesystem, complete with file and folder operations. This means you can structure your code
the way you see fit.

In your `.ts` file, you can create the following things at top level:
- `class`
- `interface`
- `enum`
- `type`

## Global Scope
We have now put the two classes `Hello` and `World` in two different files. But the question remains, how is `Hello`
able to refer to `World`? Where's the import statement? How do you even import?

That's the neat part, you don't!

In metz you don't have to deal with importing anything, because everything is made available in the global namespace.

Every class, interface, type, enum that you create in a file is made available for you to use in all your other files.

```typescript hello.ts
@Injectable
class Hello {
	/*
	* Class 'World' is simply available in the namespace, just like 'std'.
	*/
	private worldInstance = std.resolve(World);

    hello() {
        const result = this.worldInstance.world('Hello');
        std.log(result);
    }
}
```

```typescript world.ts
@Injectable
class World {

    world(arg: string) {
        return `${arg} World!`
    }
}
```

We have covered a lot of ground! We understand what puts boxes and lines on the playground. We understand
how to make our code run. Not just that, but actually show different sides of the system! We also learnt how to do all this tidily.

But to move forward, we need to look below the abstractions a little. The way our runtime works, it's fully
capable of helping you design and communicate a distributed system, a low level react component and anything in between.

It's possible because **time works differently in the runtime**.

<Tooltip tip="It's not intentional, these puns just emerge!">That's a bold statement.</Tooltip> But well worth the rabbit hole. Let's take a look under the hood, and see what it means for you!
