Metz emulates a simple in-memory filesystem, complete with file and folder operations. This means you can structure your code
the way you see fit. 

In your `.ts` file, you can create the following things at top level:
- `class`
- `interface`
- `enum`
- `type`

<Note>The folder structure also controls the visual hierarchy. [See here]()</Note>


## Global Scope
Let's say you put `UserRepository` in `user-repository.ts` and other such classes in their respective files. Similarly, `RegistrationService` ends up in `registration-service.ts`.

But how do you import `UserRepository` class in `registration-service.ts`?

That's the neat part, you don't!

In metz you don't have to deal with importing anything, because everything is made available in the global namespace. 

Every class, interface, type, enum that you create in a file is made available for you to use in all your files.

```typescript db.ts
@Injectable
class DatabaseClient {
    // ... Doing some db stuff
}
```

```typescript user-repository.ts
@Injectable
class UserRepository {
    private readonly db = std.resolve(DatabaseClient);

    // ... Managing user entity
}
```

```typescript registration-service.ts
@Injectable
class RegistrationService {
    private readonly userRepository = std.resolve(UserRepository);

    // ... Can't manage users without acquiring them!
}
```
```typescript cart-service.ts
@Injectable
class CartService {
    private readonly userRepository = std.resolve(UserRepository);

    // ... Why acquire if they are not going to buy?
}
```
