title: It begins with a class
---

Classes and methods are the fundamental building blocks of metz. A class gets rendered as a box, and its methods
as smaller boxes inside it.

<Tooltip tip="From the same class, as well as others!">A method can call other methods</Tooltip>, and that call gets rendered as a line between the caller and callee boxes.

And that's it. It's that simple!

But let's create a hello world program, just to drive the point home. And also because what kind
of tutorial doesn't have a hello world?!

<Frame>
    <iframe width="900px" height="600px" src="https://app.metz.sh/play/924372b4b43042a09d261999ad057e8c?minimal=true" />
</Frame>

And here's the code for it:

```typescript

class Main {
    /**
     * Is reponsible for many important things.
    */
    hello() {
        const result = this.world('Hello');
        std.log(result);
    }

    /**
     * Does all the heavy lifting!
    */
    world(arg: string) {
        return `${arg} World!`
    }
}
```
That `std.log` is peculiar but we will visit it later. For now, notice that the comments and input/output types also
get rendered.

So it's not just a dumb box. It has other essential properties that helps us understand the component at a glance.

<Tip>Try playing with it in the [playground](https://app.metz.sh/try), and see what happens when you add comments to the `Main` class.</Tip>

So, we have a class and and some methods. But what do we do with it? Who is instantiating it and running the code?

Let's answer that in the next section with [Stories](/stories).
